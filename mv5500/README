                 README: Motorola MVME5500 

This file contains board-specific information for the Motorola MVME5500 in
support of the MVME5500 BSP.  Specifically, this file contains information on
any BSP interface changes from previous software or hardware versions, and
contains caveats that the user must be aware of before using this BSP.
Additionally, the target board's manual page entry (for example,
MV5500/target.ref) provides board-specific information necessary to run
VxWorks, and should be read before this BSP is used.
