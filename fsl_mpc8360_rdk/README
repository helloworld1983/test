This file contains board-specific information for the Freescale MPC8360 RDK
target board. This file documents BSP interface changes from previous software
or hardware versions, and notifies the user of serious caveats that must be
noted before using this BSP. Additionally, the target board's reference entry
(i.e. fsl_mpc8360_rdk/target.ref) provides board-specific information necessary
to run VxWorks and should be read fully before this BSP is used.

RELEASE 2.0/2:

    Re-released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 3.6, VxWorks 6.6

    Add support for security engine, please refer to target.ref for detailed
    instructions.
    Switch from hEnd qeFcc driver to VxBus UCC driver.

IMPORTANT!!! Read the following carefully before installing this BSP package.

    This version of BSP will install the following driver files as well as the BSP.

    target/config/comps/src/hwif/vxbUccEnd.dc
    target/config/comps/src/hwif/vxbUccEnd.dr
    target/config/comps/vxWorks/40vxbUccEnd.cdf

    target/src/hwif/h/mii/bcm54xxPhy.h
    target/src/hwif/h/end/vxbUccEnd.h
    target/src/hwif/mii/bcm54xxPhy.c
    target/src/hwif/end/vxbUccEnd.c
    target/src/hwif/end/Makefile

    Pre-Installation Requirement:

    1) You should consider backing up the following files, so you can
       undo the install if necessary.

        target/src/hwif/h/mii/bcm54xxPhy.h
        target/src/hwif/mii/bcm54xxPhy.c
        target/src/hwif/end/Makefile


    Post Installation Steps:

    1) Build instructions for driver files outside of the BSP:
       A build of the updated drivers installed is necessary.
       In the VxWorks Development Shell, go to '$WIND_BASE/target/src/hwif'.
       Run the command:

           make CPU=PPC32 TOOL=diab

       This will archive the updated drivers into the corresponding libraries.

    2) For project builds to work you should close Workbench if you are using it.
       Next remove the file 'target/config/comps/vxWorks/CxrCat.txt'.
       You may now restart Workbench and create vxWorks image projects based
       on the new BSP.

    3) For command line builds to work you should rebuild 'target/config/all/vxbUsrCmdLine.c'.
       First remove the old vxbUsrCmdLine.c.  You should consider backing it up,
       so you can restore to use the old version if necessary.
       Next open the vxWorks Development Shell,
       go to '$WIND_BASE/target/config/comps/src/hwif' and run the command:

           make vxbUsrCmdLine.c

       This will create and copy the updated vxbUsrCmdLine.c to the 'target/config/all' directory. 

       NOTE!!! For all Windows users, please install the following patch on Wind River OLS first.

           https://portal.windriver.com/cgi-bin/windsurf/downloads/view_binary.cgi?binaryid=114704

       After the patch gets installed, rebuild the vxbUsrCmdLine.c according to the instructions above.
