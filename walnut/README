                 README: IBM PPC405GP EVB (Walnut)

This file contains board-specific information for the IBM PPC405GP 
target board.  Specifically, this file contains information on any BSP
interface changes from previous software or hardware versions, and
contains caveats that the user must be aware of before using this BSP.
Additionally, the target board's reference entry (i.e., man walnut for
UNIX or the HTML reference entries) provides board-specific information
necessary to run VxWorks, and should be read before this BSP is used.

FCS RELEASE (1.2/5)

First release for Tornado 2.0 with architecture support for PPC405 core.
This release supports MMU and caches on the PPC405 core. This release
adds new registers and assembly instruction support for the PPC405GP. 
MAC instruction support has also been added to the assembler and debugger.
An optional FPU used with the PPC405 core is also supported, though
the PPC405GP does not support this. This bsp uses the cpu type PPC405
in the bsp makefile, to take advantage of the PPC405 architecture
support. Future versions of the PPC405 having a FPU will need to use 
the cpu type PPC405F in the bsp makefile.

ALPHA RELEASE (1.2/4)

Because of the similarities between the IBM 403 and 405 architectures,
the 405GP BSP is able to use the VxWorks architecture support for the
PowerPC 403 family of processors with minor modifications and no
limitations in performance or functionality. The MMU is not supported
in the current VxWorks 403 architecture libraries. Wind River is currently
updating the libraries to include basic MMU support. This BSP will be
modified to use these updates when they are available, and the BSP will be
folded into a Wind River Tornado Development Kit update around the end
of 4Q2000.

This BSP supports the PowerPC 405GP Rev B, Rev C, and Rev D parts.  Rev A
parts are no longer supported with this release.

PROBLEMS FIXED FROM LAST RELEASE:

 - Initialization of the Individual Address Register in the EMAC controller
   (ibmEmacEnd.c)
 - I-cache and D-cache are now disabled almost immediately in romInit.s and
   sysALib.s to fix warm start problem.


What is new in this release?

   - patch405 tools are not required if a Rev. D processor is being used.
   - Wind River pciAutoConfigLib is now being used to configure PCI devices.
     See sysBusPci.c in this BSP, and see header files in
     \Tornado\target\h\drv\pci for available PCI functions.
   - Compressed bootrom, downloadable application files are supported now, but
     only for Rev D. processors because the patch405 tool is not necessary
     for Rev D.
   - More error handling in Ethernet (EMAC) driver (RX Descriptor error)
   - Many registers have been renamed to match the new scheme devised for
     the 405GP User Manual.
   - Internally derived serial clock source support has been added.
     (see UART_CLOCK_EXTERNAL in config.h)
   - sysInfoGet() and sysInfoShow() functions were added to determine and show
     CPU and various bus speed information at run time.
   - Improved PHY auto-negotiation.  EMAC full duplex operation is supported.
   - DCR register access fuctions have been added to access register for the
     on-chip memory controller (OCM), DMA controller, etc.
   - The allocation of descriptor table memory has been moved from ibmEmacEnd.c
     to malLib.c.
