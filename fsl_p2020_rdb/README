           README: Freescale P2020RDB (fsl_p2020_rdb)

This file contains board-specific information for the Freescale P2020RDB
target board.  This file documents BSP interface changes from previous software
or hardware versions, and notifies the user of serious caveats that must be
noted before using this BSP.  Additionally, the target board's reference entry
(i.e. fsl_p2020_rdb/target.ref) provides board-specific information necessary
to run VxWorks and should be read fully before this BSP is used.

RELEASE 6.9/x
    TODO:
    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 6.9, VxWorks 6.9.2

    Add Nand Flash description in target.ref. (WIND00352487)


RELEASE 6.9/5
    
    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 6.9, VxWorks 6.9.x
    
    Fix the AMP device filter. (WIND00387606)
    Added back the macro FLASH_SECTOR_SIZE. (WIND00377897)

RELEASE 6.9/4

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 6.9, VxWorks 6.9.2

    Fix a documentation error for unused address space. (WIND00280337)
    Update security engine description. (WIND00331832)
    Remove the component INCLUDE_AIM_MMU_SHOW for footprint. (WIND00334904)
    Add dependence for component INCLUDE_TFFS. (WIND00249511)
    Fixed SMP image booting issue. (WIND00314083)
    Added support for P2020RDB-PCA board with DDR3. 
    Added support for VxBus I2C and NorFlash driver.
    Flush cache in sysCpu1ShutdownLoop.
    Reset PIR before non-CPU0 reset when AMP.
    Update SPI driver.

RELEASE 6.9/3

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 6.9, VxWorks 6.9.2

    Moved L1 cache parity error handling to the arch library.  L1 cache parity 
       checking is now enabled by default. L1 parity errors now generate
       (in many cases recoverable) machine check exceptions.  (WIND00309426)

RELEASE 6.9/2

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 6.9, VxWorks 6.9.2

    Update to openPicTimerDevBresources[] to support OpenPIC timers for the 2nd
       AMP core by changing the clock source from the grounded RTC pin to the
       internal clock. (WIND00281979)
    Fixed memory mapping bugs and isolated the cores' memory from each other.
       (WIND00247805 & WIND00253685) 
    Implemented an architecture independant wrload initialization and memory
       mapping/unmapping.  Added bootrom and BSP support to execute secondary
       uAMP images with a physical bias on any 64MB boundary. Removed use of 
       M85XX_BPTR for starting the 2nd core.  It now executes through romInit
       and uses CPU1_INIT_START_ADR.

RELEASE 6.9/1

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 6.9, VxWorks 6.9.1

    Rename DRV_STORAGE_FSL_SDHC to DRV_STORAGE_SDHC. (WIND00300116)

RELEASE 6.9/0

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 6.9, VxWorks 6.9

    Modify the OR0 value to improve the nor flash performance.
    Change the SDRAM controller's CLK_CTRL timing to support the DDR found
       on rev D targets. (WIND00234239)
    Replace manual cache flushing in sysCpuEnable with calls to architecture
       functions. (WIND00239454)
    Modify the sysToMonitor SMP shutdown sequence so each CPU flushes its data
       cache before resetting. (WIND00242091)

Version 2.0/1

    Re-released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 3.8, VxWorks 6.8

    Add AMP feature support.

Version 2.0/0

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 3.8, VxWorks 6.8

    Initial release.
