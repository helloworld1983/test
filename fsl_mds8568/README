This file contains board-specific information for the Freescale MDS8568
target board.  Specifically, this file contains information on any BSP
interface changes from previous software or hardware versions, and
contains caveats that the user must be aware of before using this BSP.
Additionally, the target board's reference entry (i.e., 'man fsl_mds8568')
provides board-specific information necessary to run VxWorks, and
should be read before this BSP is used.
