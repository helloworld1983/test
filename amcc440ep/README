This file contains information on any BSP interface changes from previous
software or hardware versions, and contains caveats that the user must be
aware of before using this BSP. Additionally, the target board's manual
page entry (for example, amcc440ep/target.ref) provides board-specific
information necessary to run VxWorks, and should be read before this BSP is
used.
