RELEASE 6.9/3

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 6.9, VxWorks 6.9.2

    CQ297094: Updates to L3 cache to support access by multiple cores.
    CQ329621: SYSTEM_GLOBALS have been removed. They are replaced with the
              RESERVED_ATOMICS functionality which is implemented in the
              PPC arch-specific libraries.

RELEASE 6.9/2

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 6.9, VxWorks 6.9.2

    CQ253685: Replaced INCLUDE_DYNAMIC_WRLOAD with an architecture independant
              wrload initialization and memory mapping/unmapping.

              Changed bootrom and runtime to execute secondary uAMP kernels
              with a physical bias on any 64MB boundary.

              Reorganized romInit to make it common across QorIQ targets and
              to functionalize the TLB and cache initialization.

              a bug in MIPC_SM, since fixed 
    CQ247891: add PTEs for QMAN & BMAN's private memory buffers, restore
              LOCAL_MEM_SIZE default to 512MB, better document reserved
              space of the private memory buffers
    CQ242091: modify sysToMonitor SMP shutdown sequence so each CPU flushes
              its data cache before resetting. 
    CQ253127: document U-Boot loading of vxWorks is restricted to SDK 2.1
              in target.ref
