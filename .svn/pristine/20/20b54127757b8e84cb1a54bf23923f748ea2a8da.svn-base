This file contains board-specific information for the Motorola MPC837x
MDS target board.  Specifically, this file contains information on any BSP
interface changes from previous software or hardware versions, and
contains caveats that the user must be aware of before using this BSP.
Additionally, the target board's reference entry (i.e., 'man mds837x')
provides board-specific information necessary to run VxWorks, and
should be read before this BSP is used.
