This file contains board-specific information for the MPC8315ERDB
board. This file documents BSP interface changes from previous
software or hardware versions, and notifies the user of serious
caveats that must be noted before using this BSP.  Additionally, the
target board's reference entry (i.e. fsl_rdb8315/target.ref) provides
board-specific information necessary to run VxWorks and should be read
fully before this BSP is used.

IMPORTANT!!! Read the following carefully before installing this BSP package.

    This version of BSP will install the following driver files as well as the BSP.    

    target/src/hwif/h/end/vxbEtsecEnd.h
    target/src/hwif/h/storage/vxbFslSataStorage.h

    target/src/hwif/busCtlr/usb/hcd/ehcd/usbEhcdDataStructures.h
    target/src/hwif/busCtlr/usb/hcd/ehcd/usbEhcdInitExit.c
    target/src/hwif/busCtlr/m83xxPci.c
    target/src/hwif/busCtlr/m83xxPciEx.c    
    target/src/hwif/busCtlr/Makefile

    target/src/hwif/end/vxbEtsecEnd.c

    target/src/hwif/storage/vxbFslSataStorage.c
    target/src/hwif/storage/Makefile

    target/config/comps/src/hwif/m83xxPciEx.dc
    target/config/comps/src/hwif/m83xxPciEx.dr
    target/config/comps/src/hwif/vxbFslSataStorage.dc
    target/config/comps/src/hwif/vxbFslSataStorage.dr

    target/config/comps/vxWorks/40m83xxPciEx.cdf
    target/config/comps/vxWorks/40vxbFslSataStorage.cdf

    Pre-Installation Requirement:

    1) You should consider backing up the following files, so you can
       undo the install if necessary.

       target/src/hwif/busCtlr/usb/hcd/ehcd/usbEhcdDataStructures.h
       target/src/hwif/busCtlr/usb/hcd/ehcd/usbEhcdInitExit.c
       target/src/hwif/busCtlr/m83xxPci.c
       target/src/hwif/busCtlr/Makefile

       target/src/hwif/end/vxbEtsecEnd.c

       target/src/hwif/h/end/vxbEtsecEnd.h
              
       target/src/hwif/storage/Makefile
       
    Post Installation Steps:

    1) A build of the updated drivers installed is necessary.
       In the VxWorks Development Shell, go to '$WIND_BASE/target/src/hwif'.
       Run the command:

           make CPU=PPC32 TOOL=diab
       or
           make CPU=PPC32 TOOL=gnu

       This will archive the updated drivers into the corresponding libraries.

    2) For project builds to work you should close Workbench if you are using it.
       Next remove the file 'target/config/comps/vxWorks/CxrCat.txt'.
       You may now restart Workbench and create vxWorks image projects based
       on the new BSP.

    3) For command line builds to work you should rebuild 'target/config/all/vxbUsrCmdLine.c'.
       First remove the old vxbUsrCmdLine.c. You should consider backing it up,
       so you can restore to use the old version if necessary.
       Next open the VxWorks Development Shell,
       go to '$WIND_BASE/target/config/comps/src/hwif' and run the command:

           make vxbUsrCmdLine.c

       This will create and copy the updated vxbUsrCmdLine.c to the 'target/config/all' directory.

       NOTE!!! For all Windows users, please install the following patch on Wind River OLS first.

           https://portal.windriver.com/cgi-bin/windsurf/downloads/view_binary.cgi?binaryid=114704.

       After the patch gets installed, rebuild the vxbUsrCmdLine.c according to the instructions above.
