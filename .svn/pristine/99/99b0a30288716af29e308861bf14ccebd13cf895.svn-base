                 README: Motorola MPC827X ADS (ads8272)

This file contains board-specific information for the Motorola MPC8272
ADS target board.  Specifically, this file contains information on any BSP
interface changes from previous software or hardware versions, and
contains caveats that the user must be aware of before using this BSP.
Additionally, the target board's reference entry (i.e., 'man ads827x')
provides board-specific information necessary to run VxWorks, and
should be read before this BSP is used.


PLEASE NOTE
-----------

When used with Tornado 2.2.1, this BSP requires modified versions of 
several driver files.  The relevant SPRs are SPR #94578 and SPR #94579.
The files are included in patch_SPR94578.zip, which is included in the
distribution for this BSP.  Unzip and install this patch to obtain
the modified driver files.

The modified driver files should be included in a future Tornado 2.2.X
release and/or in a cumulative driver patch.  If this BSP is used with
version of Tornado subsequent to 2.2.1 or with cumulative driver patch
number 2 or later, check whether the SPR modifications have already been
included before installing the patch included with this BSP.
The patch is not provided for vxWorks 6.x.
