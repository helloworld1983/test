                 README: Wind River SBC 8540

This file contains board-specific information for the Wind River SBC 85xx
target boards.  Specifically, this file contains information on any BSP
interface changes from previous software or hardware versions, and
contains caveats that the user must be aware of before using this BSP.
Additionally, the target board's manual page entry (i.e., wrSbc8540/target.nr
or wrSbc8560/target.nr) provides board-specific information necessary to 
run VxWorks, and should be read before this BSP is used.
