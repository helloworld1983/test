README: Freescale HPC-NET 8641(D)

This file contains information on any BSP interface changes from previous
software or hardware versions, and contains caveats that the user must be
aware of before using this BSP. Additionally, the target board's manual
page entry (for example, hpcNet8641/target.ref) provides board-specific
information necessary to run VxWorks, and should be read before this 
BSP is used.

RELEASE 2.0/2

    Miscellaneous smallish updates for VxWorks SMP EAR.
    Driver changes from rev1 pulled into vxWorks 6.6 code base. 

RELEASE 2.0/1

    !!!! WARNING BSP install will include non-BSP specific files.
    !!!! WARNING The installation of this BSP will break some PCI support for 
    other BSPs which use vxBus PCI drivers (eg wrSbc8560/ixdp4xx). It is meant 
    primarily for vxWorks 6.4. Look for an update for other versions of vxWorks 
    greater than 6.4. A new PCI library will be installed to support multiple 
    PCI/PCI Express controllers and Message Signal Interrupts. It is advised you 
    use a seperate install of Workbench for this BSP.

    Due to defect 88168  GEI HEnd driver will be installed without transmit 
    checksum enabled by default.  

    Added support for the PCI Express bus controllers. 

    PPC DEC timer now uses vxBus infrastructure.

    BUILD INSTRUCTIONS for non-BSP files
    ------------------------------------

    A build of the drivers installed is necessary.
    In the vxWorks Development Shell, go to target/src/hwif.
    make CPU=PPC32 TOOL=sfdiab
    The gei driver installed should build.

RELEASE 2.0/0

    Released by Wind River for Workbench 2.6, vxWorks 6.4

    Provide project build support for TIPC and shared memory configuration in 
    config.h. Tested basic TIPC BSP support.

    Supported DDR Freq is 400Mhz
    Supported OSCILLATOR_FREQ are 40Mhz and 50MhZ.
    Default board settings out the box should work.

    Dual Core could only be tested on the ArgoNavis V1 board due to hardware 
    availability. No changes should be required to this software for the later 
    versions of the board. Single core was tested.

    Changed BSP name.
    Fixed issue with connecting to 100BaseT/10BaseT.
    Support dual core with dual vxWorks image.
    Must provide MACH address via bootline 'M' command before trying to use 
    network.
    Now use vxBus abstraction layer for ETSEC/MII/DUART.

    Early Access Version(EAR)

    All 4 TSECS validated.
    Standard 7448 core is supported which includes the L2 cache.
