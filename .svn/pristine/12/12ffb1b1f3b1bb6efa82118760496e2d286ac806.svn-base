                 README: simpc BSP for Windows VxSim

This file contains board-specific information for Windows VxSim. Specifically,
this file contains information on any BSP interface changes from previous
software or hardware versions, and contains caveats that the usermust be aware
of before using this BSP. Additionally, the target board's manual page entry
(for example, simpc/target.nr) provides board-specific information necessary to
run VxSim, and should be read before this BSP is used.
