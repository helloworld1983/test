                 README: Motorola MVME5100

This file contains board-specific information for the Motorola MVME5100
target board. Specifically, this file contains information on any BSP
interface changes from previous software or hardware versions, and
contains caveats that the user must be aware of before using this BSP.
Additionally, the target board's reference entry (i.e., mv5100/target.ref)
provides board-specific information necessary to run VxWorks, and
should be read before this BSP is used.

RELEASE 2.0/6:

        update revision number for NOR release

RELEASE 2.0/5:
        SPR 97843 - warm reboot fails on 750
       
RELEASE 2.0/4:
        Released by Wind River for Tornado Base6.

RELEASE 2.0/3:
        Released by Wind River for Tornado Base 6 TAR.

RELEASE 1.2/2: Tornado 2.2
	Verified mvme5106/MCP755 support (no change required).
	SPR 73782, 74005, 74006: Removed local .cdf files
	SPR 74102: Update TFFS, correct target.nr, remove 
		local tffsConfig.c and README.TFFS.
	

RELEASE 1.2/1
	Added support for mvme5110/MPC7410 ("Nitro") CPU
	Maintenance release.  Problems Fixed:
	SPR 70061: 'task dead' after vxMemProbe of VME
	SPR 70749: Correct mapping of PMC slot 2 IDSEL
	SPR 70703: L2 Icache flush before disable
	SPR 70613: SCRAMnet PMC initialization cannot be done; use scramconf
	SPR 70442: VME shared INT/LM mailbox usage
	SPR 70441: doc errors in target.nr
	SPR 69443: Project facility 'Rebuild all' fails on NT
		Duplicates: 69132, 69324
	SPR 69298: MPIC Spurious INT.  This is fixed, but the fix
		required a modified fei82557End.o module in the BSP.
	Fix for SCSI boot, although the spurious error message may
	still appear.
	Fix for i8250Sio.c (see below) is included in this release.

Known Problems:
   1.) The PReP Memory Map (#undef EXTENDED_VME) does not work.
       #define EXTENDED_VME is mandatory.

   2.)	SPR 71519: RMW-cycle potential lockup
	A 64-bit VME read or write that is interrupted by a VME RMW
	cycle can cause the Hawk to lock up.
	This is a hardware bug in either Hawk or Universe (still under
	investigation at time of release): MCG has HW-simulated the 
	problem.  It is slightly different from Universe Errata #20.
	
	W/A: Don't undef ANY_BRD_IN_CHASSIS_NOT_RMW; the VOWN software
	TAS will not fail, but does cause some loss of performance.
	If using H/W TAS, that is, #undef ANY_BRD_IN_CHASSIS_NOT_RMW,
	then do not use 64-bit VME accesses.

   3.)	TFFS is not supported in the current release.  The
	existing support is out of date.

RELEASE 1.2/0
	First FCS release of the mv5100 BSP by WRS.  Includes Beta releases
	from Motorola, from version 1.2/0.1 thru 1.2/0.3.

Known problems:

   1.) Super I/O ports COM2 and COM3 may lock up under heavy loading.
       This is fixed in i8250Sio.c available in the T2 Cumulative Patch 2
       available on WindSurf. [FIXED in 1.2/1]

   2.) When INCLUDE_SCSI is defined the following warning may appear while
       the vxWorks kernel is loading:

            Attached TCP/IP interface to er0.
            Subnet Mask: 0xffffff00
            Attaching network interface lo0... done.
            Loading... 853680
            Starting at 0x100000...

            interrupt: sym895EventTypeGet : SCSI Bus Fault
            interrupt:  sym895Intr: Fatal Error, Restarting SIOP...
            0xf7f6328 (tScsiTask): sym895Event invalid event type (89)
            Attached TCP/IP interface to er unit 0
            Attaching network interface lo0... done.

       When this error message appears, the SIOP does restart and SCSI 
       continues to operate normally.
