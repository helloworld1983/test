                 README: Motorola MPC834X ADS (ads834x)

This file contains board-specific information for the Motorola MPC834x
ADS target board.  Specifically, this file contains information on any BSP
interface changes from previous software or hardware versions, and
contains caveats that the user must be aware of before using this BSP.
Additionally, the target board's reference entry (i.e., 'man ads834x')
provides board-specific information necessary to run VxWorks, and
should be read before this BSP is used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 6.9, VxWorks 6.9.2

    Correct resource type of general purpose timer. (WIND00278669)
    Fixed potential memory corruption caused by sysNvRamGet(). (WIND00101057)

RELEASE 6.9/0

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 6.9, VxWorks 6.9

    Delete _MMU_UBAT_VP attribute. (WIND00162540)
    clear mot83xxPci.h. (WIND00212294)

RELEASE 2.0/8:
    
    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 3.8, VxWorks 6.8

    Fixed WIND00121316 - Define two start flags and provide accurate delay 
                         routine in I2C driver.
    Fixed WIND00046377 - Added workaround for errata LBC2.
    Fixed WIND00118187 - Support USB host and target.
    vxSvrGet() support - Move vxSvrGet() from sysALib.s to vxALib.s.
    Code integration   - Integrate the USB target support by INCLUDE_FSL_TCD

RELEASE 2.0/7:

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 3.7, VxWorks 6.7

    Modified to support MPC8349EA-MDS board. This version is compatible with
    ADS834X. Now the default configuration is for MPC8349EA-MDS. To support
    ADS834X board, macro MPC8349EA_MDS in config.h should be undefined.

RELEASE 2.0/6

    Released from Wind River for VxWorks 6.6

    Released from Wind River for Workbench 2.6, VxWorks 6.5

    Added support for the IPNet Network Stack.
    Correct wrong vendor code for the MAC address.(CQ:86932)

RELEASE 2.0/4

    Changes:
    WIND00069944 - Added usbPciStub.c dummy function for compatability

RELEASE 2.0/3

    Changes:
    WIND00069071 - no longer swap MAC address in load string.
    WIND00061530 - replace magic numbers.
    Fixed Defect 60694.
    Added vxBus Support for TSEC HEnd driver and Timer drivers.
    Added support for Rev3 silicon on for RevA board using DDR1.
RELEASE 2.0/2

    Changes:
    SPR 113600 found and fixed. PCI outbound windows set incorrectly.

RELEASE 2.0/1

    Changes:
    
    Added support for startType, MAC storage in pseudo NVRAM. 
    Using Rev1.1 silicon as default. 
    PCI2 support added but interrupts untested due to PIB issues.
    USB2.0 EHCI host controller support added for rev1.1 silicon only.
    
    SPR#111361 A fix is required for USB stack which is not due to be released
    until vxWorks 6.2. A simple fix see published description.
    
    This BSP assumes revision 1.1 silicon or earlier for setting clk speed 
    to allow all silicon to work. Expect Rev2 silicon will support 667Mhz.
    out of the box. 
    Must modify config.h for MPC8343 and rebuild bootrom.
    MPC8343 was not tested due lack of hw.
    More information about board clk configuration was added.
    
    SPR#110686 Performance enhancements - This BSP has been modified to improve 
    the TSEC device driver and 8349 hw performance. Also a one line change is 
    required to the motTsecEnd.c driver which will be detailed in the published 
    description.
    
    Errata:
    CPU4 - Means illegal address access may cause CPU to hang therefore some 
    BSP error tests will fail. This is the reference to machine check 
    unsupported in earlier rev of BSP.
    
    Undefine REV1_1_SILICON and define REV1_0_SILICON, if using rev1.0 silicon, 
    in config.h and will ensure pci auto config not used and also ARB1 errata will be implemented (requires new bootrom).
    
    Important Info
    
    A new bootrom must be created if using previous versions of BSP due to MAC
    storage change.
    No longer supporting rev1.0 silicon although was tested.
    MPC8343 not supported.
    Default CPU clock freq is 400Mhz and DDR 266MHZ. If you want to change this
    you must build a new bootrom and look at changes required to hard reset 
    configuration word(HRCW) set in config.h and detailed in target.ref.
    64 bit PCI is the default setting and requires a new bootrom to change.
    See ads834x.h for some HRCW settings and freescale MPC8349E reference manual. 
    Cannot use switch settings on board to set HRCW, this is unsupported.
    Added support for startType, MAC storage in pseudo NVRAM.

RELEASE 2.0 /0

    Modified for vxWorks 6.x
    Added support for CPU_VARIANT _83xx
    Added support for extra BATs and breakpoints.
    bootrom.hex image now supported.
    
    EAR:
    
    PCI Autoconfig will not work - Errata
    PCI support therefore requires prior knowledge of PCI slot being used. 
    The example supplied for GEI and FEI is for them present in PMC#1 of the 
    platform Base Board and therefore will only work if one or the other enable 
    with the correct device. GEI expected is 82543. 
    If the bootrom accesses via configuration cycle unpopulated PCI slot this 
    will cause the board to hang.
    Interrupt assignment was done manually.
    
    PCI support was tested on the platform base board only which is available 
    from Freescale.
    
    Machine Check Exception is not supported and will cause the board to hang if 
    triggered.
    
    TFFS support is only for part of the flash 0xffc00000 -> 0xfffe0000. 
    Below this is the boot image area and above is for boot parameter storage. 
    To include TFFS you need to add cfiscs.o to MACH_EXTRA in Makefile.
