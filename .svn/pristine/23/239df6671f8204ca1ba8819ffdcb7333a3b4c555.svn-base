    Modify CCSBAR mmu table size. (WIND00247711)

Version 2.0/3

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 3.8, VxWorks 6.8

    Removed macro INCLUDE_SMP_DEMO. (WIND00160267)
    Update openPicTimer support.

Version 2.0/2

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 3.7, VxWorks 6.7.

    wrload and MIPC integrated into ads8572_AMP_core0/1 BSPs. 
    PCI slots support added via ULi bridge.
    modify FLASH driver from common driver(<mem/flashMem.c>) to local driver
    ("flashMem.c").(CQ:WIND00121156)

Version 2.0/1

    This is meant for use with vxWorks 6.6.0.59 which is vxWOrks 6.6 with 
    an E500V2 patch which includes SMP support.
    AMP support has issues when PCI is enabled. AMP builds are in seperate
    BSPs directories because of the differences in address space 
    configuration. Look in ads8572_AMP_core0/core1.

Version 2.0/0

    This is meant for use with vxWorks 6.6 EAR CD. It is not FCS quality.
