                 README: Motorola MV3100 

This file contains board-specific information for Motorola MPC8540-based
boards.  Specifically, this file contains information on any BSP interface
changes from previous software or hardware versions, and contains caveats
that the user must be aware of before using this BSP.  Additionally, the
target board's manual page entry (for example, mv3100/target.ref) provides
board-specific information necessary to run VxWorks, and should be read
before this BSP is used.

RELEASE 2.0/5

    Released from Wind River for VxWorks 6.6.

    Renamed BSP from mpc8540 to mv3100. mpc8540 was the processor name,
    mv3100 is the BSP name.
    The GPP & PNE distinction in the mpc8540End driver object code has been
    removed as of this release. However, the mpc8540End.obj shipped with this 
    BSP is still only valid with the release of vxWorks for which it was built.

    FCS release for VxWorks 6.4.  
    Updated Makefile to use mpc8540_vxWorks6_4.obj
    Fixed USP Spurious Interrupt
    Verified backward comptibility with vxWorks 6.2 and 6.3

RELEASE 2.0/2

    FCS release for VxWorks 6.3.  
    Fixed vxprj build errors.
    Fixed and verified USB (bulk devices, keyboard and mouse).
    Verified sATA support.
    Added mpc8540vxWorks6.3.obj objects for vxWorks 6.3 support.
    Refer to notes below on End object for use with various vxWorks versions.
