\sh 2. Flashing the Boot ROM Image Using Workbench

   This section describes how to program a VxWorks bootrom image onto 
   a flash bank using Workbench 2.6 (or later) and the Wind River ICE 
   plugin. Note that the Wind River Probe (USB) is also supported and 
   uses the same basic instructions as the Wind River ICE but does not 
   require an IP address.

   If you want to preserve the UBOOT image, switch the flash bank that 
   will be used for the bootrom image using SW9 pins 1 & 2. 00 -> 11
   This switches bank 1 and bank 0 of the flash bank and should prevent 
   UBOOT from being overwritten. Note that UBOOT can be used to program 
   a VxWorks bootrom image.
   

   Using Workbench, complete the following steps to flash your boot ROM image:
          
	a) Create a bootrom.hex image.

	Create a VxWorks boot loader project based on the ads8572 BSP.
	You can use the default compressed image. However, use hex 
	format in place of the elf format.
	After the project is created, build the default image.
 
	b) Install the WindRiver ICE and power it on.

	Connect the JTAG interface cable from the Wind River ICE to the 
	ADS8572 board JTAG connector (located on the CPU card). When all 
	of the connections have been made, power up the ADS8572 board and 
	create a Wind River ICE connection in Workbench.

	c) Configure the Workbench connection.

	When creating the connection, specify the MPC8572 CPU.
	Enter the IP address of the Wind River ICE when requested.

	d) Load the proper ads8572 register setting for WindRiver ICE.

	Once you have connected the probe to the CPU, right-click on the 
	connection in the target manager and attach to the CPU core. At 
	this point, you can go to the main Workbench Window tab at the top 
	of the view and select "show view". Browse the view list and select 
	OCD Command Shell. This launches the original BKM command shell.
	Navigate to the target manager and right-click on core(U1). Select 
	reset and download. You can now put the register file in this BSP or 
	one provided by the installation in "play register file" 
	(for example,mpc8572e_whitefin_uboot.reg). Reset with IN then click the 
	reset download button. You have now loaded the target board with 
	enough settings to program the boot ROM. Select "Window > show view" 
	again and select Flash Programmer.

	e) Converting the bootrom.hex file to bootrom.bin.

	Select the Add/Remove tab in the flash programmer. Click 
	"convert file" and navigate to the boot loader project you created 
	previously e.g. WindRiver\workspace\ads8572BootProj\bootrom.hex. 
	Select the project. The start adress should be 0x0 and the end 
	adress should be set to 0xfffffff. Click "convert and add" to convert 
	the file. 
 	At this point, the file is added to the list. Click on the start 
	address entry (should be 0x0) and change it to 0xfff00000. The file 
	is now ready for programming.


	f) Program the ads8572 flash.

	Select the configuration tab and choose the following device:
	AMD -> S29GL01 -> 65536 x 16 -> 1 Device.

	Set the base address to 0xf8000000.
	Set the start address to 0x5000. 
	Set the size to 65536.

	Select programming tab and set the following options:

	Set the erase from setting to 0xfff00000.
	Set the erase to setting to 0xffffffff.

	Go to OCD command shell and type IN. Be sure this returns the BKM 
	prompt and is OK. Return to the flash programmer and select the 
        Batch Program tab and then select the Initialize/Erase and Program 
	checkboxes. Click Execute.
	Wait for the programmer to complete.
	You can now run the VxWorks boot ROM by going back to the OCD command 
	shell and typing "INN" followed by "GO". Alternatively, you can 
	disconnect the ICE and proceed to Step 3 "Running the VxWorks Boot 
	ROM Program".

\sh 3. Flashing the Boot ROM Image Using the on-board boot loader        
   
	The version of U-Boot used for these instructions was:	
	U-Boot 1.3.0-rc3 (Dec  4 2007 - 01:21:14)

	The MPC8572-DS reference board is shipped with a
	factory-programmed UBOOT boot loader capable of downloading a
	Boot ROM image using its tftp client and programming it in the
	alternate flash bank. SW9 pin1 &pin2 are used to switch between flash 
	banks. set baud rate to 115200 for u-boot. A tftp server is required. 
	In the following instructions, the tftp server IP address is 
	128.224.146.96.

	For some reason u-boot has moved the address of the flash after it 
	starts up in the latest version to support this board. The 
	instructions have been modified to match. If however you have an 
	early version of u-boot the flash was previously at 0xf8000000 as 
        mapped by u-boot instead of 0xe8000000. You should modify the 
	addresses below to match.  
	The following instructions describes all the steps that must
	be performed. You are only required to type in the line following
	the "=>" UBOOT prompt.
	
	a) set the target ip address.
   
	=> setenv ipaddr 128.224.147.196
   
	b) set the tftp server ip address
   
	=> setenv serverip 128.224.146.96
   
	Note: Additional environment changes may be required for
	your network.
   
	c) save the environment
   
	=> saveenv

	d) get the bootrom image from the tftp server and store
	it in RAM at address 0x1000000.
   
	=> tftp 10000000 bootrom_uncmp.bin
   
	e) erase the alternate Flash bank
   
	=> erase ebf00000 ebffffff
   
	f) program the flash at location 0xebf00000 for 0x100000 bytes.
	Note that the number of bytes to program will depend on the image
	size. The actual number of bytes in the image is available in the
	output of step 'd' above after 'Bytes transfered'. It will be 1MB by 
        default unless you change the ROM_SIZE to create a larger image.
   
	=> cp.b 10000000 ebf00000 100000
   
	At this point, the Boot ROM image is programmed and is ready
	to be used once these additional steps are complete.
   
	g) Turn off the target
   
	h) Toggle switch 9 position 1 & 2 to swap the flash banks
   
	i) Turn on the target.
   
        
\sh 4. Running the VxWorks Boot ROM Program

	To run the VxWorks boot ROM program, complete the following steps:

	a) If you have not already done so, disconnect the Wind River ICE.
	Note that if the ICE remains connected, it can stop the processor at 
	the first instruction in certain cases.

	b) Connect the Ethernet and serial channels.
	
	i) Connect the serial port to the host using the supplied serial 
	cable.
	ii) Connect the RJ45 Ethernet cables to the ETSEC ports which 
	are next to the serial port. The connector ontop is ETSEC1 and is used
	as the standard boot device.

	c) Launch a terminal program on the host and configure as follows:

	8 data bits
	1 stop bit
	no hardware handshaking 
	parity disabled
	baud rate = 115200 bps

	d) Power cycle the board.

	If the board is not already powered off, turn it off momentarily. 
	Then, power the board on. At this point, you should see characters 
	being printed to the terminal window signaling the boot countdown. 
	Press any key to stop the count down. You are now ready to configure 
	VxWorks. For detailed instructions, see the VxWorks Kernel 
	Programmer's Guide.

ROM_WARM_ADRS | ROM_TEXT_ADRS + 8 | warm Reboot Entry Address
ROM_SIZE | 0x0010_0000 | default 1 MB of ROM
\te

\sh Support for L2 Cache
L2 Cache is configured with callback function pointers for L2 Cache Global 
Invalidation, L2 Cache Enable, L2 Cache Flush, and L2 Cache Disable. These 
function pointers are initialized in sysHwInit( ). By default, the 256 KB 
L2 is configured to 256 KB of cache. If a different configuration is desired, 
a new boot ROM image should be used to match the RAM image configuration of 
the L2.

\sh Boot Process

Upon reset, the MPC85xx begins executing from 0xFFFF_FFFC. Only the last 
4 KB of memory is mapped by the TLB. The instruction at 0xFFFF_FFFC branches 
to resetEntry( ) (which is located at the last 2 KB of memory) to begin 
initialization and mapping of memory static TLB entries. The DDR SDRAM is 
then mapped to 0x0 where the vectors are set up for use and execution is 
then transferred to RAM after copying and uncompressing (if necessary). 

The boot ROM for the ADS8572 allows you to load VxWorks with four eTSEC 
Ethernet channels. In the boot dialog, these channels correspond to the 
"motetsec0" and the "motetsec1" devices. To switch between the boot devices 
after a load is attempted, a hard reset or power cycle is necessary in order 
for the device to function properly. After the reset, press a key to stop 
the count down and use the "c" command to change the boot device to the 
desired network device. 

To configure the MAC address of the ETSEC devices you must use the M command:
\cs
[VxWorks Boot]: M
Set device MAC address

  0  quit
  1  motetsec0  31:31:92:1e:a0:00

\ce

An Intel 82573-based PEX NIC can be plugged into an empty slot. 
The config.h must be modified to define INCLUDE_GEI8255X_VXB_END. If the 
8257x PEX NIC is plugged into the PCIEX slot1 or 2. 
Then, you will need to rebuild the boot ROM with the above changes in 
config.h. At this point, you can re-flash the boot ROM to flash memory. The 
boot device for Intel 8254X gigabit controllers is "gei".


\sh AMP with wrload and MIPC

The default bootrom provided from either ads8572_AMP or the ads8572 BSP
may be used to boot the board with UP, AMP or SMP images.

You must use the Workbench or vxprj to build the BSPs.
You can build any AMP image for either core0 or core 1 from the 
ads8572_AMP BSP, but each image must be configured manually 
with the appropriate components.

The image for core 0 must be configured with
BUNDLE_AMP_PRI (Primary core bundle) which adds all required MultiOS components, including wrload, MIPC and MSD (MIPC Serial Device), and the optional but very useful WDB proxy.

The image for core 1 must be configured with 
BUNDLE_AMP_SEC (Secondary core bundle), which adds
all required secondary core MultiOS components, including MIPC and MSD 
(configured as client), 
and INCLUDE_WRLOAD_IMAGE_BUILD.
Additionally, the secondary core must be configured with INCLUDE_AMP_CPU_01 
(Kernel configurations: hardware -> BSP configuration variants -> vxWorks AMP core build).

The secondary core image uses the DEFAULT_BOOT_LINE by default, so you want 
to set this parameter in your vxWorks Image Project. 
For example (all on one line, no breaks, note the escaped internal double-quotes):

$ vxprj parameter set DEFAULT_BOOT_LINE "\"motetsec(2,0)host:<image_dir>/vxWorks 
h=192.168.1.1 e=192.168.1.2 u=vxworks pw=vxworks f=0x0\""

Boot the image created with BUNDLE_AMP_PRI from the bootrom.
Call wrload using the following either add as part of the usrAppInit or call 
from a shell such as the target shell.
For Example:

-> wrload "-file <image dir>/vxWorks -cpu 1"

The image you load should be the image built with BUNDLE_AMP_SEC and INCLUDE_AMP_CPU_01.

\sh DDR RAM Size
This BSP can support up to 512 MB DDR memory. By default, only 512MB DDR 
memory is configured in config.h. Change the definition of LOCAL_MEM_SIZE 
in romInit.s for your desired DDR memory size and chip selects. Auto-detect 
has not been implemented.

\sh Network Configuration
The ETSEC port allows a 10/100/1000T connection. 
The driver will auto-negotiate and configure the port accordingly. 
The BSP also supports Intel GEI 82573 NICs with the PCIEX interface.

\sh ROM Considerations

UP/SMP and AMP with WRLOAD

The bootrom.hex file is provided with the ads8572 BSP is prebuilt and will work
 for all 3 BSP variants. The boot ROM is configured to a ROM base address of 
0x0. When programming the boot ROM to the flash, an offset of 0xFFF00000 needs 
to be used.

\sh Boot Flash
There are two flash banks on the ADS8572 board.

\sh PCI/PCI Express Support

There are three PCI Express host controllers on the MPC8572.

The support for multiple PCIEX bus conrollers and vxBus PCI devices is 
provided by a new vxBus PCIEX bus controller driver and PCI config 
libraries which will be added.

Support for Message Signal Interrupt (MSI) has been added via EPIC and 
PCI bus controller driver.

There is the Errata "PCI-Ex2" (Chip Errata for the MPC8572E PowerQUICC
III Processor Rev. D) for Revision 1.0 which exists in
REV.B assembly of the ads8572E-DS chassis. This errata causes PCIe
link between 8572 PCIe controller and PEX device fails after /HRESET. The 
workaround is enabled in hardware configuration resource `pciExt2ErrataFlag'.
This workaround has been fixed in silicon revision 1.1.1 of MPC8572E
populated in REV.D assembly chassis.

\sh TrueFFS

Unsupported 

\sh Serial Configuration

The UART device is configured with 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, hardware
handshaking, and parity disabled.  The device operates at 115200 bps. The
on-chip DUART on the MPC8572 is supported. However, only one channel of the 
DUART is used on the ADS8572 reference boards.

\sh Programmable Interrupt Controller

The PIC driver provided by this BSP supports all internal and external 
interrupt sources. The driver can also be configured to route such interrupt 
sources to the critical interrupt pin. However, because critical interrupts 
are routed directly to the interrupt source instead of being manager by the 
PIC with IACK or EOI, the Critical Interrupt Summary registers are used to 
check for the source. The transient values in these registers cause a spurious
vector when indexing into the vector table.
Support for shared message interrupt for PCI Expresss MSI has been added.
