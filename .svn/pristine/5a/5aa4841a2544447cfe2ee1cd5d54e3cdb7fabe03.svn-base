                 README: Wind River SBC834x (wrSbc834x)

This file contains board-specific information for the Wind River SBC834x
target board.  Specifically, this file contains information on any BSP
interface changes from previous software or hardware versions, and
contains caveats that the user must be aware of before using this BSP.
Additionally, the target board's reference entry (i.e., 'man wrSbc834x')
provides board-specific information necessary to run VxWorks, and
should be read before this BSP is used.

RELEASE 2.0/5
        
    Released from Wind River for Workbench 2.6, VxWorks 6.4 

RELEASE 2.0/4
    FCS Release for vxWorks 6.3
    
    New in this release:
    - USB Host support
    - PCI autoconfiguration support

RELEASE 2.0/3
    FCS Release for vxWorks 6.1
    
    New in this release:
    - Manual configuration of an Intel Pro1000 Ethernet PCI adaptor is
        supported.

RELEASE 2.0/2
    New in this release:
    - Full 128MB local bus SDRAM is accessible at 133Mhz.

RELEASE 2.0/1
    New in this release:
    - Non-volatile memory support added, including boot parameter and
      MAC address storage.
    - Added support for assigning MAC addresses via the bootrom 'M' command.
    - System start type, used by ED&R, is now supported;
    - Expanded support for the 7-segment LED.
    - Moved the TFFS area to 0xff800000 -> 0xffc00000, so it no longer
      includes the reset configuration word and boot image areas.

RELEASE 2.0/0
    
    EAR Release for vxWorks 6.1
    
    Known Hardware Issues:
    - Bootrom doesn't always execute after power-on reset or when
       	  reset button is pressed (possibly due to MPC834x errata RESET1);
    - Only 64MB of 128MB local bus SDRAM is accessible;
    - Local bus SDRAM can only run up to 66Mhz;
    - PCI Autoconfiguration will not work (MPC834x errata);
    - If an unpopulated PCI slot is accessed at boot time (via a
      configuration cycle), the board will hang;
    - To avoid mechanical interferences with the Plexiglas enclosure,
      the PCI slot should only be used in the stand-alone configuration.
    - Machine Check Exception is not supported and will cause the board to
      hang if triggered;
    - USB and I2C interface circuitry are untested.
    
    Known Software Issues:
    - Non-volatile memory and boot parameter storage are not supported;
    - System start type, used by ED&R, is not supported;
    - The MAC addresses for the 'mottsec' interfaces are hardcoded in the
      load string in sysMotTsecEnd.c, function sysMotTsecEndLoad();
    - TFFS support is only for part of the flash (0xffc00000 -> 0xffffffff),
        which includes the reset configuration word and boot image areas.
        To include TFFS, cfiscs.o must be added to MACH_EXTRA in Makefile;
