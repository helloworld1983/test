This file contains board-specific information for the Freescale MPC8360
MDS target board.  Specifically, this file contains information on any BSP
interface changes from previous software or hardware versions, and
contains caveats that the user must be aware of before using this BSP.
Additionally, the target board's reference entry (i.e., 'man mds8360')
provides board-specific information necessary to run VxWorks, and
should be read before this BSP is used.

RELEASE 6.9/x
    TODO:
    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 6.9, VxWorks 6.9.x

    Fixed potential memory corruption caused by sysNvRamGet(). (WIND00101057)

RELEASE 6.9/1

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 6.9, VxWorks 6.9.2
    
    Update the description of Security Engine. (WIND00331832)

RELEASE 6.9/0

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 6.9, VxWorks 6.9
    
    Delete _MMU_UBAT_VP attribute(WIND00162540)
    Clear mot83xxPci.h. (WIND00212294)

RELEASE 2.0/6

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 3.8, VxWorks 6.8

    Fixed WIND00139815 - Support net device in BootApp.
    Remove QE IO port pin mux codes.
    Remove qeCpcrReset().
    Move vxSvrGet() from sysALib.s to vxALib.s.
    Update quiccEngine configuration.

2.0/5

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 3.7, VxWorks 6.7

    Switch from hEnd qeFcc driver to VxBus UCC driver

2.0/4

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 3.6, VxWorks 6.6

    Use vxBus based drivers for interrupt controllers, timers and PCI. 
    Intialize floating point registers during initialization.

2.0/3

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 3.5, VxWorks 6.5

    Add modification to support MDS8360EA. This version is compatible with MDS8360.
    The default configuration is for MDS8360EA. To support old MDS8360 board, macro
    MPC8360EA_MDS in config.h should be undefined.

2.0/2

    Addition of 20bsp.cdf for project and workbench builds. 20bsp.cdf is new
    for this release.

2.0/0

    PCI support is now supported and tested on Freescale Platform IO Board(PIB), 
    however configuration of PIB through I2C is not working.

    Errata ENET 15 is patched into Quicc Engine for rev1.1 silicon.

    Quicc Interrupt controller was fixed.

    Issue with illegal address access when MMU is enabled is hanging the board. 
    It can cause reboot/vxMemProbe to fail on occasion. Cause is unknown yet but 
    can clear the state with debugger using sync command, memory access and 
    resume, not always succesful.
    CPU4 errata means that illegal address access when MMU is disabled is hanging 
    the board. It is possible to clear the state with debugger using sync command,
    memory access and resume, not always succesful. 

    Added support for statistics in qefcc driver but some stats not functional. 

    Using more vxBus specific drivers by default.

EAR:

PCI is not supported as configurations cycles are broken.
Quicc Engine is supported for FCC(UEC) only and is configured to function 
upto Gigabit speeds. 10BaseT mode isn't supported.
Switching between 100BaseT and Gigabit connections dynamically doesn't work. 
Not all standard ioctls are supported by the fcc network driver such as 
promiscuous mode and multicast support.
