        README: vxWorks BSP for Freescale MPC8313ERDB

This file contains board-specific information for the MPC8313ERDB
board. This file documents BSP interface changes from previous
software or hardware versions, and notifies the user of serious
caveats that must be noted before using this BSP.  Additionally, the
target board's reference entry (i.e. fsl_rdb8313/target.ref) provides
board-specific information necessary to run VxWorks and should be read
fully before this BSP is used.
