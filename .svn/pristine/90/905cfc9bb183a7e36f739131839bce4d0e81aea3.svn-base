This file contains board-specific information for the Freescale Lite5200B
target board. Specifically, this file contains information on any BSP
interface changes from previous software or hardware versions, and
contains caveats that the user must be aware of before using this BSP.
Additionally, the target board's manual page entry
(i.e., lite5200b/target.ref) provides board-specific information necessary to
run VxWorks, and should be read before this BSP is used.
