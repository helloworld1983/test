\TITLE VxSim solaris/simpc/linux - Wind River VxWorks Simulator for Solaris, Windows and Linux

NAME
`Wind River VxWorks Simulator solaris/simpc/linux'

INTRODUCTION
This reference entry provides target-specific information necessary to run
the Wind River VxWorks Simulator (aka VxSim) on Solaris, Windows and Linux.

STARTING VXSIM
The vxsim application performs the VxWorks bootrom simulation. It consists
of handling the boot parameters, loading VxWorks image, allocating memory
and controlling the reboot. On a real target, the boot parameters can be
specified via the VxWorks boot prompt (part of VxWorks bootrom).  On
VxWorks Simulator, all the parameters available in the standard VxWorks
boot line can be specified via vxsim application options.

To start the VxWorks Simulator with default options, if VxWorks image is in the
current working directory, run the following command:
\cs
    vxsim
\ce
Otherwise
\cs
    vxsim -f <file name> | -file <file name>
\ce

To show the list of VxWorks Simulator command line options, run the command:
\cs
    vxsim -help
\ce
For further information about launching VxWorks Simulator, please refer to
\tb Wind River VxWorks Simulator User's Guide: Getting Started .

VXSIM MEMORY CONFIGURATION
To specify the VxWorks memory size (memory available for VxWorks), use the
-size|-memsize option:

\cs
vxsim -size <memory size> | vxsim -memsize <memory size>
\ce
`NOTE:' If this option is set, the LOCAL_MEM_SIZE VxWorks parameter is
not taken into account.

The following table summarizes the different configurable parameters and
how to configure them:

\ts
                     | Configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Physical Base Address| LOCAL_MEM_LOCAL_ADRS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Physical Memory Size | LOCAL_MEM_SIZE
		     | -size\|-memsize option
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Virtual Base Address | -vaddr option 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Virtual memory Size  | -vsize option (Up to 1Gb)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\te

WDB BACK END
VxWorks Simulator is supporting WDB pipe and WDB RPC target agent
communication back ends, WDB pipe back end is the default one. If network
support is enabled in VxWorks Simulator, the WDB RPC back end can also be
used. For further informations about WDB back end configuration, please
refer to
\tb Wind River Workbench User's Guide: Target Management .

DEVICES
\sh Standard Input/Ouput
A sio driver is provided for standard input and output.
On Unix simulators, Unix job control characters are enabled
even when the I/O is in raw mode. Trapping of control characters like ^Z
is UNIX-shell specific and does not conform to the usual VxWorks tyLib
conventions. Trapping of ^C character is performed by the Kernel Shell
when included.

\sh Virtual disk
A virtual disk is available to emulate a VxWorks disk by using a single host
file. The virtual disk is a raw disk that can be used for VxWorks or user
defined file systems. This feature is enabled when the INCLUDE_VIRTUAL_DISK
component is included in the VxWorks image.  It is possible to create as many
disks as necessary. For further information, please refer to
\tb Pass Through File System
section of
\tb Wind River VxWorks Simulator User's Guide: Hardware Simulation .

\sh Host Serial Input/Ouput driver
The hostSio driver is available to access one of the host serial devices from
VxWorks Simulator.  By default, this feature is not included. To add the host
serial device support, the component INCLUDE_HOST_SIO must be defined into the
BSP configuration. Then, the macro HOST_SIO_PORT_NUMBER can be used to select
which host serial device to use.

\sh Timer
As any VxWorks target, VxWorks Simulator provides a system and an auxiliary
clocks. The macros SYS_CLK_RATE_MIN, SYS_CLK_RATE_MAX, AUX_CLK_RATE_MIN and
AUX_CLK_RATE_MAX are defined to provide parameter checking for the
sysClkRateSet() and sysAuxClkRateSet() routines. To get accurate results
system clock rate should not exceed host clock rate (usually 100 ticks/sec).

`NOTE:' VxWorks Simulator clock can be impacted by the activity on your
machine if the VxWorks Simulator process is preempted by another process. In
such a case, the current activity of each VxWorks task is delayed by an
interval of time corresponding to the preempted time of process.

\sh File system
The default file system is the pass-through file system (`passFs'), which is
unique to VxWorks Simulator. The INCLUDE_PASSFS component is included by
default to mount this file system on startup.
`PassFs' is a file-oriented device driver which provides an easy access to the 
host file system. To specify the passFs device name (default : \<host name\>),
use the command line option:
\cs
vxsim -hn <host name> | -hostname <host name>
\ce
The default value for the passFs device name for Unix is the name of the host
running simulator. On Windows, for backward compatibility with previous
releases, the default value is "host".

The VxWorks syntax to access a host file system is summarize in the following
table:
\ts
Host      | passFs syntax                        | Example
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`Unix'    | \<passFs device\>:/dir/file          | -> ls "myhost:/myDir/myFile" (Assuming "myhost" is the host running VxSim)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`Windows' | \<passFs device\>:/\<disk\>/dir/file | -> ls "host:/c/myDir/myFile"	(Recommended sytax)
          | \<passFs device\>:\<disk\>:/dir/file | -> ls "host:c:/myDir/myFile" (Deprecated syntax: kept for backward compatibility)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\te

`NOTE:' PassFs is using Unix like path separator even on Windows simulator.
For further information, please refer to
\tb Pass Through File System
section of
\tb Wind River VxWorks Simulator User's Guide: Hardware Simulation .

For further information about hardware device simulation, please refer to
\tb Wind River VxWorks Simulator User's Guide: Hardware Simulation .

NETWORKING
VxWorks Simulator provides full network capability. A VxWorks network END
driver called simnet is available to allow VxWorks Simulator to connect to
one or several sub-networks.

For further information, please refer to
\tb Wind River VxWorks Simulator User's Guide: Networking with the VxWorks Simulator ,
\tb Wind River Network Stack Programmer's Guide .

TIMESTAMP DRIVER
The timestamp driver is used to extend the range of information available
from VxWorks kernel instrumentation. For example, if the timestamp driver
is available, a precise time line can be displayed by WindView. VxWorks
Simulator contains a system-defined timestamp driver. This feature is
selected (this is the default) by including INCLUDE_TIMESTAMP and
INCLUDE_SYS_TIMESTAMP components in your VxWorks image.

`NOTE:' WindView graph can be impacted by the activity on your host
machine if the VxWorks Simulator process is preempted by another process.
In such a case, the current activity of each VxWorks task is delayed by an
interval of time corresponding to the preempted time of process.

NVRAM
The Non-volatile RAM is simulated by a host file accessed by the
sysNvRamGet()/sysNvRamSet() APIs.

The default non volatile ram file is located in the same directory than the
VxWorks image and is named:
\cs
nvram.<VxWorks image name><processor number>
\ce
The following command line option is available to specify another NVRAM host
file location:
\cs
vxsim -n <file name> | -nvram <file name>.
\ce
Deleting the host file manually cleans the non-volatile RAM content. A new
file will be created by the next simulator startup.

As with any VxWorks target, the non-volatile RAM default size is defined to 256
bytes. To tune the NVRAM default size, the macro NV_RAM_SIZE is available into
the BSP configuration and in the project facility. After a non-volatile RAM
default size modification, the host file is resized during VxWorks Simulator
startup.

`NOTE:' The boot parameters set via `vxsim' command line options, or using
bootChange() are saved in the Non-volatile RAM, but they are not preserved
when the simulator is stopped and restarted.

SHARED MEMORY
\sh Shared memory End driver
VxWorks Simulator provides Shared memory End driver support. This driver
is not included by default. To add the Shared memory End driver support to your
vxWorks image, the INCLUDE_SM_NET, INCLUDE_SM_COMMON and INCLUDE_SMEND 
components must be included in your VxWorks image. Then, when starting the
simulator, use "vxsim -b <inet on backplane> | vxsim -backplane 
<inet on backplane>" option to define the simulator shared memory end driver
IP address. For more information on Simulating a Shared Memory Network with
VxSim, please refer to
\tb Wind River VxWorks Simulator User's Guide: Hardware Simulation .

\sh VxMP
VxWorks Simulator provides VxWorks multiprocessors capabilities, "VxMP".
This feature is not included by default. To add the VxMP support to your
BSP, the INCLUDE_SM_OBJ and INCLUDE_SM_COMMON components must be included in
your VxWorks image.

Shared memory objects and End driver require a signaling method and a method
of mutually exclusive memory resource access. VxWorks Simulator is using
interrupts as shared memory communication signaling method. Shared memory
resource mutual exclusion (spin lock) is implemented using test-and-set
(TAS) sysBusTas() routine.

The shared memory content is removed when the master simulator (SM_MASTER)
is rebooted or stopped. On VxWorks Simulator implementation, slave
simulators are not rebooted after a master simulator reboot. 

FLOATING POINT
Floating point support is available in VxWorks Simulator.

CACHE SUPPORT
The cache support is simulated by VxWorks Simulator, the supported mode is
the CACHE_COPYBACK mode.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
To exit the simulator type '^\\' (quit) on Unix, or close the simulator window
on Windows. To exit the simulator programmatically use reboot() with
BOOT_NO_AUTOBOOT(1) parameter.

The VxWorks Simulator memory is preserved after a simulator reboot.
