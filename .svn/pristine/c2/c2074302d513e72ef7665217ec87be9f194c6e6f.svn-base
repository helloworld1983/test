                 README: Motorola MVME6100 

This file contains board-specific information for the Motorola MVME6100 in
support of the MVME6100 BSP.  Specifically, this file contains information on
any BSP interface changes from previous software or hardware versions, and
contains caveats that the user must be aware of before using this BSP.
Additionally, the target board's manual page entry (for example,
MV6100/target.ref) provides board-specific information necessary to run
VxWorks, and should be read before this BSP is used.
