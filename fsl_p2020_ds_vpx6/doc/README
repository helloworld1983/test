This file contains board-specific information for the Freescale P2020DS
target board.  This file documents BSP interface changes from previous software
or hardware versions, and notifies the user of serious caveats that must be
noted before using this BSP.  Additionally, the target board's reference entry
(i.e. fsl_p2020_ds/target.ref) provides board-specific information necessary
to run VxWorks and should be read fully before this BSP is used.
