\sh Flashing the Boot ROM Image Using Workbench

   This section describes how to program a VxWorks bootrom image onto 
   a flash bank using Workbench 2.6 (or later) and the Wind River ICE 
   plugin. Note that the Wind River Probe (USB) is also supported and 
   uses the same basic instructions as the Wind River ICE but does not 
   require an IP address.

   The SBC8641D board has two Intel 28F128P30T 16MB Strata flash chips, U17
   and U61. The board comes pre-flashed with a VxWorks bootrom in U17 and
   a UBOOT image (with Linux kernel and ramdisk images) in U61. Jumper JP10
   controls which of the two flash chips is visible: putting the jumper in
   position 1-2 selects U17 (VxWorks) and putting it in position 2-3
   selects U61 (UBOOT).

   Note that this design does not allow both Strata flash banks to be
   visible concurrently. Consequently, it isn't possible to use UBOOT
   from U61 to flash new VxWorks bootrom into U17. Instead, the Wind
   River ICE or Wind River Probe must be used, according to the
   instructions below.

   Using Workbench, complete the following steps to flash your boot ROM image:
          
	a) Create a bootrom.hex image.

	Create a VxWorks boot loader project based on the wrSbc8641d BSP.
	You can use the default compressed image. However, use hex 
	format in place of the elf format.
	After the project is created, build the default image.
 
	b) Install the WindRiver ICE and power it on.

	Connect the JTAG interface cable from the Wind River ICE to the 
	wrSbc8641d board JTAG connector. When all of the connections have been made,
  power up the wrSbc8641d board and create a Wind River ICE connection in Workbench. 

	c) Configure the Workbench connection.

	When creating the connection, specify the MPC8641d CPU which is with 
        86xx group.
	Enter the IP address of the Wind River ICE when requested.

	d) Load the proper wrSbc8641d register setting for WindRiver ICE.

	Once you have connected the probe to the CPU, right-click on the 
	connection in the target manager and attach to the CPU core. At 
	this point, you can go to the main Workbench Window tab at the top 
	of the view and select "show view". Browse the view list and select 
	OCD Command Shell. This launches the original BKM command shell.
	Navigate to the target manager and right-click on core(U1). Select 
	reset and download. You can now put the register file in this BSP or 
	one provided by the installation in "play register file" . Reset with 
	IN then click the reset download button. You have now loaded the target 
	board with enough settings to program the boot ROM. Select "Window > show view" 
	again and select Flash Programmer.
	
	e) Converting the bootrom.hex file to bootrom.bin.

	Select the Add/Remove tab in the flash programmer. Click 
	"convert file" and navigate to the boot loader project you created 
	previously e.g. WindRiver\workspace\wrSbc8641dBootProj\bootrom.hex. 
	Select the project. The start address should be 0x0 and the end 
	address should be set to 0xfffffff. Click "convert and add" to convert 
	the file. 
 	At this point, the file is added to the list. Click on the start 
	address entry (should be 0x0) and change it to 0xfff00000. The file 
	is now ready for programming.


	f) Program the wrSbc8641d flash.

	Select the configuration tab and choose the following device:
	INTEL -> 28F128P30T -> 8192 x 16 -> 1 Device.

	Set the base address to 0xff000000.
	Set the start address to 0x00000000. 
	Set the size to 65168.

	Select programming tab and set the following options:

	Set the erase from setting to 0xfff00000.
	Set the erase to setting to 0xffffffff.

	Go to OCD command shell and type IN. Be sure this returns the BKM 
	prompt and is OK. Return to the flash programmer and select the 
  Batch Program tab and then select the Initialize/Erase and Program 
	check boxes. Click Execute.
	Wait for the programmer to complete.
	You can now run the VxWorks boot ROM by going back to the OCD command 
	shell and typing "INN" followed by "GO". Alternatively, you can 
	disconnect the ICE and proceed to Step 3 "Running the VxWorks Boot 
	ROM Program".
        
\sh Running the VxWorks Boot ROM Program

	To run the VxWorks boot ROM program, complete the following steps:

	a) If you have not already done so, disconnect the Wind River ICE.
	Note that if the ICE remains connected, it can stop the processor at 
	the first instruction in certain cases.

	b) Connect the Ethernet and serial channels.
	
	i) Connect the serial port in the carrier card to the host 
	using the supplied serial cable.
	ii) Connect the RJ45 Ethernet cables to the TSEC ports which 
	are next to the serial port. The top left next to/above serial is
  TSEC1. 

	c) Launch a terminal program on the host and configure as follows:

	8 data bits
	1 stop bit
	no hardware handshaking 
	parity disabled
	baud rate = 9600 bps

	d) Power cycle the board.

	If the board is not already powered off, turn it off momentarily. 
	Then, power the board on. At this point, you should see characters 
	being printed to the terminal window signaling the boot countdown. 
	Press any key to stop the count down. You are now ready to configure 
	VxWorks. For detailed instructions, see the VxWorks Kernel 
	Programmer's Guide.

The user configurable options are in config.h.

\sh TrueFFS
This BSP uses one lower 8MB 28F128P30T flash as the TrueFFS media.
To use it, define INCLUDE_TFFS in config.h.
When using TrueFFS on a new flash for the first time, you should format the
flash using
\cs
    sysTffsFormat();
\ce

Then
\cs
    usrTffsConfig(0, 0, "/tffs0");
\ce
If you want to know the current format process when calling the sysTffsFormat,
define TFFS_FORMAT_PRINT in sysTffs.c.

If you want to load a vxWorks image from a TFFS Flash disk, define MACRO as follow in config.h
\cs
#define INCLUDE_TFFS
#define INCLUDE_TFFS_MOUNT
#define INCLUDE_FS_EVENT_UTIL  
#define INCLUDE_FS_MONITOR     
#define INCLUDE_ERF            
#define INCLUDE_DEVICE_MANAGER 
#define INCLUDE_XBD            
#define INCLUDE_XBD_TRANS
#define INCLUDE_XBD_BLK_DEV    
#define INCLUDE_DOSFS_MAIN
#define INCLUDE_DOSFS_FAT
#define INCLUDE_DOSFS_DIR_VFAT
#define INCLUDE_DOSFS_DIR_FIXED
\ce

\sh PCI Express
The Wind River SBC8641D board has two PCI express slots. Each slot
corresponds to a separate PCIe host bridge on the MPC8641D CPU, which
are supported using a VxBus PCI controller driver. PCI support is off
by default, but can be enabled by including the INCLUDE_PCI_BUS component.

\sh Secondary PCIe ethernet
When PCIe support is enabled, any of the VxBus ethernet drivers that
support PCIe devices can also be enabled. Supported devices include
the Intel PRO/1000 8257x controllers, the RealTek PCIe gigE and 10/100
controllers and the Marvell Yukon II. Support for the Intel PRO/1000
devices will be included automatically when INCLUDE_PCI_BUS is defined
(INCLUDE_GEI825XX_VXB_END will also be defined).

\sh NVRAM Support
This BSP implements non-volatile RAM via the on-board EEPROM device.
An 8-bit 8KB EEPROM, U18, is provided for non-volatile memory storage.
It contains boot parameters and the eTsec's MAC addresses.

\sh LCD support
A 2*16 character module is available for a display device. The manufacturer is 
DATA-MODUL.BTQH 21603V-FFSMN-LBD RED WITH CONN

\sh Network Configuration
The ETSEC ports allows 10/100/1000T connection.
The driver will auto-negotiate and configure the port accordingly.
The BSP also supports Intel 82546/82545/82544/82540/82543/82571/82572/82573
based NICs

The following END and corresponding END2 drivers are supported in this BSP.
However, only END driver is enabled by default.

\ts
Driver | END                      | END2
----------------------------------------
TSEC   | INCLUDE_ETSEC_VXB_END    | INCLUDE_ETSEC_VXB_END2
\te

To enable the END2 driver, you should modify as follows:

For command line build, add INCLUDE_END2 into config.h right after the
definition of INCLUDE_END. Also replace the END driver name with corresponding
END2 driver name, then rebuild the bootrom and vxWorks image.

For project build under Workbench, in the Kernel Configuration Window of your
created VxWorks Image Project, add INCLUDE_END2 component and corresponding END2
component, this will un-define END automatically. Then rebuild your project.

\sh AMP board configuration

In order to run in AMP mode, the low memory offset option for the second
core must be enabled. This permits the second core to use the second 256MB
bank of memory while making it appear to be mapped at address 0. The
same VxWorks image can then be used on either core.

To enable low memory offset mode, switch SW4:5 must be set to the on
position. The board typically ships with this feature turned off,
so this switch setting must be changed before AMP mode will work. This
switch should turned back off to run the board in SMP mode.

\sh LEGACY AMP support
The BSP supports running the MPC8641D in AMP mode, with separate VxWorks
images running on each core. AMP mode can be enabled by defining
INCLUDE_AMP in config.h.


NOTE: currently, the SBC8641D boards come pre-loaded with a VxWorks 6.4
bootrom in flash. AMP mode will not work correctly until this bootrom is
updated with a newer one (i.e. one built from this BSP). This is because
the earlier bootrom does not enable the second DDR controller, which
prevents the second 256MB RAM bank from being used.

The second CPU can be started by calling startCPU1() in usrAppInit.c or from 
target shell. You should have shared memory included (INCLUDE_SM_COMMON) and 
the host machine should have route added to point to the backplane ip address 
that the shared memory interface is using. The backplane ipAddress 
recommended is X.X.X.1 as it is incremented.

 CPU: Wind River SBC8641D.  Processor #1.
 Memory Size: 0x10000000.  BSP version 2.0/0.

-> 

Building with project facility/Workbench kernel configurator requires each 
image to have the shared memory interface configured manually as it does not 
start it automatically on cpu0 and assumes the enet address not the backplane 
address from the bootline should be used on cpu1.


\sh AMP with wrload and MIPC

You must use the Workbench or vxprj to build the BSPs.
You can build any image for core0 from the wrSbc8641d_AMP_core0 BSP.
This image is configured for AMP, wrload and MSD (MIPC serial device).
For core1 you can build a RAM based image (vxWorks) and is also configured 
to be loaded by wrload and to route the console to core0. 
See documentation on MIPC/wrload and MIPC Serial Device for details. 


\sh Networking support with AMP
In AMP mode, the four ETSEC ports are divided up between the cores, such
that motetsec0 and motetsec1 are available on the first core and motetsec2
and motetsec3 are available on the second. This configuration can be
customized by editing the resource entries in hwconf.c. When used in this
configuration, the TSEC_MDIO driver is required in order to arbitrate
access to the MDIO port between cores.

By default, the VxWorks image on the second core will try to download its
symbol table via the shared memory interface, using the first core as a
gateway. In order for this to work, the host system (i.e. the one from which
the target will fetch the symbol table) must have a routing entry which
allows it to communicate with the second core using the first one as
a gateway.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

\sh Known Problems

The SBC8641D board includes two 256MB banks of DDR SDRAM, but the
VxWorks 6.4 bootrom that comes pre-flashed on some boards does not
enable the second DDR controller, which renders the second RAM bank
inaccessible. This will break support for AMP mode, which requires
access to the second bank of memory. In order to fix this, the board
must be reflashed with a new bootrom that has INCLUDE_DDR_SDRAM2 defined
in config.h.

On VxWorks 6.6, with power management (INCLUDE_CPU_PWR_MGMT and
INCLUDE_CPU_LIGHT_PWR_MGR components) configured, i.e. NAP mode enabled,
and heavy interrupt rates, potential board lock-ups have been encountered
on this board.  For more information regarding the issues and workarounds,
please refer to the VxWorks 6.6 Release Notes and defect WIND00104713 (SMP)
and defect WIND00111630 (UP).
