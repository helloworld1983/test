This file contains board-specific information for the Freescale MPC8548
CDS target board.  Specifically, this file contains information on any BSP
interface changes from previous software or hardware versions, and
contains caveats that the user must be aware of before using this BSP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE 6.9/3
    TODO:
    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 6.9, VxWorks 6.9.x

    Fixed potential memory corruption caused by sysNvRamGet(). (WIND00101057)
    
RELEASE 6.9/2

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 6.9, VxWorks 6.9.2

    Remove the component INCLUDE_AIM_MMU_SHOW for footprint. (WIND00334904)

RELEASE 6.9/1

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 6.9, VxWorks 6.9.2

    Moved L1 cache parity error handling to the arch library.  L1 cache parity
    checking is now enabled by default. L1 parity errors now generate
    (in many cases recoverable) machine check exceptions.  (WIND00309426)

    Created define for SYS_MODEL, required by BSPVTS. (WIND00063968)

RELEASE 6.9/0

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 6.9, VxWorks 6.9

    Add vxprj support for DDR sizing and fix SDRAM setup.
		
RELEASE 2.0/6

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 3.8, VxWorks 6.8

    Fixed WIND00128435 - Redefine DATA_SEG_ALIGN in BSP.
    Fixed WIND00069939 - Defined CDS_SYSTEM2 by default as described in
                         target.ref
    Fixed WIND00153695 - Remove unused INCLUDE_PPC_FPU
    Remove RAM_LOW_ADRS and RAM_HIGH_ADRS defines in config.h (WIND00185815)

RELEASE 2.0/5

    Released from Wind River for General Purpose Platform 3.7, VxWorks 6.7

    Support END2 versions of ETSEC drivers

RELEASE 2.0/4

    Released from Wind River for VxWorks 6.6 

    Additional VXBUS support (interrupt controller, PCI, serial).  VXBUS now
    required.
    Correct DUART2 interrupt number.(WIND00095933)
    Correct AUX_CLK_RATE macros to pass auxclk test.(WIND00063974)

RELEASE 2.0/3

    Updates to the NOR release. New IP stack.

RELEASE 2.0/2

    Support PCI Express for CDS_SYSTEM2 which includes rev2.0 silicon or
    later.
    CDS_SYSTEM2 defined which means this BSP now supports rev2 silicon. See 
    target.ref for details of CDS_SYSTEM2 vs CDS_SYSTEM1.
    You ideally should use CDS_SYSTEM2 if you want SRIO or PCI-Express.
    All four ETSEC devices are supported on the rev1.3 carrier card
    (CDS_SYSTEM2).
    This BSP release may supercede that of the BSP released for vxWorks 6.4 
    which will not support CDS_SYSTEM2.

    IMPORTANT - MUST READ

    There are a few files that are patched with the BSP install, they are 
    required for this BSP. This means you must recompile target/src/hwif 
    using make CPU=PPC32 TOOL=sfdiab as well as target/src/drv/end. The 
    shared memory driver and gei driver are needed to be updated for PCI
    Express 82573 NIC and the SRIO support. Alternatively you can copy them
    into the BSP and compile and link there by adding the object names to 
    MACH_EXTRA in the Makefile. Serial RapidIO,the ETSEC and the Marvell Phy
    are patched in target/src/hwif.

RELEASE 2.0/1

    SRIO support is now available for point to point with two CDS8548 
    systems. 
    ETSEC functionality has been added including checksum offload support 
    and filer capability.
    VXBUS infrastructure is now used for ETSEC and SRIO. These devices are 
    configured via hwconf.c including the MII bus and PHY driver.
    There is backward compatibility with the END TSEC driver and can be 
    configured if necessary but not for SRIO which requires vxBus to be 
    included.

RELEASE 2.0/0

    SRIO not supported for this first release, waiting until silicon works
    with a JTAG workaround during reset. 
    ETSEC - enhanced features such as checksum offload not supported in this
    release but is planned. Only standard TSEC features supported for now.
    PCI is supported but will need the JTAG workaround for early revisiions
    of the silicon to enable a functional interface. WindRiver ICE and Probe 
    have this workaround available for the silicon. Only slot 4 is supported
    on the Arcadia X3 backplane and a 64-bit GEI NIC was used to test.
    PCI Express not supported yet. Note: legacy interrupts not available 
    from standard board - a newer Rev of the CPU card and carrier card needs
    to be done to support this. MSI unsupported.

    Continued sensitivity of the CDS8548 to vibration with JTAG connected 
    has been observed.

    Supported CDS8548 system is the following:
    Arcadia X3 motherboard
    CDS Carrier rev 1.2
    CDS CPU Card rev 2.0

    This BSP will move to the VXBUS infrastructure for some drivers for 
    vxWorks 6.3 which includes the serial RapidIO and ETSEC. There are 
    already changes in the BSP to support this which may not make alot of 
    sense at this time. This means anyone wanting the additional 
    functionality should expect to migrate to vxWorks 6.3.

    L2 cache library will require modification to support rev2 silicon. 
    Expect this to be done whenever Rev 2.0 silicon is made available for 
    testing. This will affect L2 SRAM and sysL2ExternalWriteBuffer used by
    TSEC.

    ETSEC in halfduplex mode doesn't work. The reason is two errata in 
    pre-rev2.0 silcon. One which affects the default HAFDUP settings used 
    which is fixed ETSEC driver not the TSEC End driver. The second results
    in a TX stall and requires re-tranmission of the packet otherwise the 
    driver no longer will transmit. The workaround is intrusive and leaves
    to a non-deterministic data rate, this should be fixed in rev2 silicon 
    until then we do not support halfduplex mode.

    EAR Version 2.0/0

    Issues:

    Only Rev1.1 silicon supported
    PCI tested on old arcadia board but was unreliable. 
    Expect to work on latest X3 version but untested.

    SRIO has been tested:
    Requires GEN6 pll workaround via JTAG. TIPC_SM/SM END is working.
    Require addition of smUtilLib.o to MACH_EXTRA - should be temporary.

    PCI-Express:
    Configuration cycles working but no device tested yet. Devices will be
    on bus==1 not bus==0 which only has controller.

    PCI2 not available

    JTAG connection seems to be delicate try to keep target isolated and 
    away from interference.

    Partially tested security engine drivers for SEC2.0 may still be issues.
    Additional features SEC2.1 not supported in present drivers.

    Only support 1GHz Core 400Mhz DDR to reduce configuration/initialization
    issues.
